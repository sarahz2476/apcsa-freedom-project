### Takeaways
I have finish my freedom project expo and presentation. Overall, I feel like doing this project helped me improve as a coder and also a presenter. After finishing, I have time to reflect on my experience.

#### Expo Experience
Before the actual expo, we had preparation. Specficially we had to make [elevator pitch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UXdE6_EbZTECpbPdxyXAIWn-jDlFFXnNDL2OwYFiyZc/edit?usp=sharing) for our project. A elevator pitch is a short introduction. The expo itself was nerve wreaking at first but later it got easier. Here is my score from the judges about my project (it is out of 4):

Creativity: 2.5 <br>
Usability: 3.5 <br>
Enjoyability(09)/Practicality(10/11/12): 3.5 <br>
Presentation: 3.5 <br>

The part that I need to improve the most is creativity and I agree since I felt like our project did not have that much features which is something I can improve on in the future. From the expo, I learn how to create a effective elevator pitch and the importance of preparation. Without the prep before the expo I would have botched the elevator pitch.

#### In-Class Presentation.
After the expo, we also had to give an in-class presentation. Compare to the expo, this presentation is more formal. My slides for the presentation is [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ts-R3d-wly-ERXzzUwvy3dt_8hbUBbGSlEaOZzce7XQ/edit?usp=sharing). Here is my score from Mr.Mueller for my presentation:

Hook: 2/2 <br>
Coherence: 2/2 <br>
Presence: 2/2 <br>
Visuals: 2/2 <br>
Conclusion: 2/2 <br>
Presentation Grade: 10/10

From the feedbacks that I learned is that I should double check everything since my code in slide 9 was a bit diffcult to see. This is really valuable for future presentation that are much more high stake. Like the expo, presenting was nerve wreaking since I felt like I did not prepare enought but in the end everything work well and I am really proud.

### Engineering Design Process/ Skills
I am in the last stage of the Engineering Design Process which is <i>Communicating the results</i>. I am proud of myself for getting this far and I am really satisfy with how everything went and the grades/feedbacks I got. 

The skills that I have honed is <b>communications</b> and <b>organization</b>. Because I have a partner, I had to communicate with her own how we should present our project and also set up time to practice our presentation. Since she was on the camping trip, I have to keep in touch with her on our progress. To present our project, we had to organize many informations. We need to find the simplest way to present the process behind our project thus we had to go back to our blog entry and find the highlight in our process. 

### Overall...
I am happy on how everything turn out. This is our last freedom project and I am happy that it is over (lol). Either is was a experience that helped me grow so I am grateful for it. Thank you for tuning in! The end!
