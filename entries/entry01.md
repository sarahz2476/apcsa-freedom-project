## Content
My partner, Nina, and I decided to use CS50 as our tool to make a web application. The web app will be a study guide for our AP Computer Science A (APCSA) course. We will mainly focus on week 6 to 9 topics (from CS50) in order to create our APCSA study guide web app. I think it will be a good review whenever we add the units' content into our project. Our MVP for the app so far is for it to have tabs of APCSA units and inside each tabs, it will contain contents of each units. We are considering to add little quizzes to each units and link videos from Youtube about that unit. For each unit, we have thought about including tips on how to approach certain types of question on the AP test. We can add a unit about reviwing the AP test that gives tips on taking the APCSA test, like how a student can structure their APCSA free-response questions. 

## Sources
While trying to decide if I want to use CS50, I would watch videos of different lectures on the official [CS50 Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/cs50) and code along during the video. In the channel, it includes videos of old lectures which is extremely helpful. For example, there are two videos on <i> Lecture 7: SQL </i> from two different years. I have also look through the official [CS50 website](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2021/fall/). In this website, it includes notes and slides for each week of the topics.  They also include problem sets to help students practice. 

My partner and I did consider making our study guide into a apple app using [swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/). But I feel like it would have been too much to learn. Another con about creating our study guide as an ios app is that Android user can not use our app and I know some people in the class has an android phone instead of an ios phone. 

## Engineering Design Process
I would say I am currently at step 4 of the Engineering Design Process -- <b> Plan the most promising solution </b>. I know what I will be making and I will be starting to learn how to code my project in the most promising way (that I am able to). I am still in the process of learning about my tools but I have a precise vision on how I want the project to be. The MVP (core) of the project will be a web application that has contents of all units in APCSA. As my partner and I learn more about APCSA throughout the year, we will be adding in the contents of each topic in, which is beneficial for us to gain a better understanding of each topic and help us better prepare for the AP test. Some things we are considering/suggesting to add into the study guide if we have time is:
 - small quizzes on each units
 - include video links related to each units
 - how to approach AP test questions for different types of question and different units

My next step would be to start going deeper into learning about CS50. Specifically, I would go deeper into learning Python as I am considering on using Python for this project since Python is more productive compare to other programming language and it is easier to read the code. These pros are helpful, especially with avoding syntax errors.

## Skills
The skills I used so far is <b>Creativity</b> and <b>Communication</b>.

I use my <b>Creativity</b> skills because to decide on making this project I had to innovate ideas. I know that I wanted to make an study guide. But let's be honest, study guides are pretty basic so we (Nina and me) had to think outside of the box to add ways for our study guide to be more specific, like adding little quizzes. We also had to use our creativity to brainstorm ideas on how our web app should look like. Our decisions on making a study guide was also based on how we can benefit from making this study guide.

I develop my <b>Communication</b> skills too. This is the first time I worked with a partner for the Freedom Project. Because this is a partnership, we had to articulate our suggestions and listen to each other. We respect each other's ideas/suggestions which help make out partnership easier. Communcation skills help us avoid unnecessary misunderstandings or conflicts that may arise.
