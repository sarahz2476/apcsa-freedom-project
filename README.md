# APCSA Freedom Project
by Sarah Zhang

## Context
The “Freedom Project” for APCSA is all about creating a project with a tool that students will learn on their own. This project is open-ended which means that our project can literally be anything we want. The purpose of this blog is to record down my process of creating the freedoom project and include some notes of my tool and code snippets.

## Content
For my project, I am making APCSA study guide. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying Harvard CS50 (specfically python AND flask) in order to make web application that contain all my notes for the APCSA course to help study for the APCSA exam while also documenting the process of me actually coding the product.

## Implications
The purpose of my project is to inform. My project does not neccessarily have direct global, social, or economic impacts. It does effect education. My project can be consider another resource that student can have to study for the APCSA exam. If it is good enough, more students might be able to pass the exam which will effect the statistics of the city. It has a social impact because if more student understand the APCSA content, there might be more future software engineerers. It does have economics impact when people paid money in order to access these notes. Plus people who know how to code can use that skills to earn money lowering umempolyment. 

However at the same time that my web application can be used to study, some student might think that because most info is on the web app, they can cram for the exams. Also instead of taking their own notes they might just use mine which might not help them understand Java. My web app is more on informing meaning student will not get hands on hands experience with coding Java with my web app. Another thing to consider is that my app is consisted of my notes which means there is room for errors. 

Thinking about the implications that my project might have helps me think of what features I can add to my project the future with more advance coding skills
